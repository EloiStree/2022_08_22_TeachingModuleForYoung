Title: Learn the basic of 3D printing
In short: Short initiation of what is a 3D printer and how it works step by step to print models from the web.
Four words: Initiation - 3D Printer - Basic - PLA 
Time: 1-2-5 days

Participant will be able to do at the end:
- Fetch STL file from web and print them on Ender 3 like printer
- Understand how to calibrate a printer and clean it
- Understand the vocabulary of the 3D printer world
- Know the very basic of what is Fusion 360 without know how to use it.
- Be able to know where to learn Fusion 360

Participant will be able to do if they pratice after the workshop:
- Be able to print with confidence model at home and
- Be able to asks help to FabLabs to print bigger pieces over there
- Start learning how to use Fusion 360 and Cuda

------------------

The ability of 3D print in life is very helpful and very easy.
But most are affraid that it must be hard to learn.

In this module, you will have a first visite around what you have to know and what are the step to print what you need.
Depending of the timing, a first demonstration of what is Fusion360 can be done.
