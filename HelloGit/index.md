[Hello Git](HelloGit/index.md) , 2-5 days: Learn the basic how to never lose your work with Git.

------------------------

Git, for me, should be teach at all kids over 14-15 years old. 
This tool:
- is intemporal,
- is no so hard when you take time to learn it
- is very good when you need to work in team on a project
- is very efficient as backup system (for small files)
- is good at teaching how to be reviewed by a community (when public)
 

In this module, the participants learn together to use the versioning system Git to be able to use it in their daily life.
(The module is not design for developer but can be if needed. )
