-----------------------------------------

If you have already 3D print, you are maybe looking at an other machine in the FabLab you visited.
The CNC machine, that remove chunk of wood to create shape.

It is less commun to use this because you need to handle the dust.
But it provide very hard structure that can be easily automated when you need to produce them.

This module is going to teach how to us Fusion 360 to design basic 3D pieces and how to teach the machine to create those in the wood:

Warning:  
Cutting to wood is a bit more complicated that printing in 3D. You need to dose at what rate you cut through wood. 
This module is an introduction. You need to pratice it in a FabLab for best result. 

At the end of this workshop you will be:
- able to know vocabulatry of Fusion 360 and CNC machine in a conversation
- able to measure the reality and create a file to speak with the CNC.
- able to go in FabLab with the good vocabulary and files to ask help.
- able to design 3D models and 2D sketches that can be shared.
- able to use a 3018-Pro CNC to drawn dot on some paper.
