Title: Basic of Low Bluetooth communication 
In short: In this workshop we learn to use Arduino software to set BLE devices and make the communicate by UART and/or Keyboard input.
Four words: BLE - Communication - Arduino Compatible - Basic 
Time: 3-5 days

Participant will be able to do at the end:
- Install Arduino Software and add the library needed for BLE Adafruit device
- Create a Keyboard from Arduino BLE for Phone & Computer
- Create UART communication between devices

Participant will be able to do if they pratice after the workshop:
- Learn all the small tricks you can do with AT command from BLE to the device
- Be ready to use the BLE device in small projet or hackathon ( not professionnaly)

Note:
- This workshop is hard. For beginner but hard.
- This workshop required 3-4 BLE devices or that the participant have one in a list.
