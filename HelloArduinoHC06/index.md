Title: Classic Bluetooth communication for Arduino with HC06 HC05 
In short: Learn how to communicated between your HC05 HC06 to your phone or computer
Four words: HC0N - Classic Bluetooth - Communication -  Arduino 
Time: 3-5 days

Summary: HC05 and HC06 are small component of 2-3e that can create communication between the Arduino and devices.
It is very praticle if you need continue communcation between two devices. But it requires to learn how to use it and how to solder some resistances to it. 


Participant will be able to do at the end:
- Create Bluetooth communication between an Arduino to a device with HC06
- Change the name and password of HC05
- Know how to install and solder a HC0N on an Arduino.

Participant will be able to do if they pratice after the workshop:
- Master the communcation between Arduino sensors and more complexe devices
- Remote control Arduino Pin with Bluetooth from Wifi App on Phone
