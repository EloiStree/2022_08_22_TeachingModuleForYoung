## Exploring Module

Exploring modules are a week of exploration on a topic where it is hard to find expert on.
I prepare the module by exploring the topic for 2-3 weeks before the workshop.
Then explore, help and guide with the participants while exploring with them.
The aim is always to do a GitHub review at the end with what was learn.

Example of topic I have in my to-do-list:
- Arduino BLE: Learn how to do communication between Arduino and your device (PC/Phone) and your Arduino.
- Etherum: Learn how to do Ehterum transationction from C# to use in Application.
- Lynx VR: Can we do augmented reality application with the Lynx? If yes what are the condition.
- Oculus Calibration: Is Oculus precise enough to be able to do measure applications for the market.
- PayPal API: Is it easy to use PayPal in application? If yes, is it easy enough for beginner in C#?
